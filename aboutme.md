I am an experienced UX designer, specializing in facilitating discovery and defining requirements, leading user research, prototyping for concept validation, and introducing design thinking to teams.

I also create cover art, design print book interiors, and format e-book editions for books and zines.

I live in Seattle and work at [Formidable](https://formidable.com).
